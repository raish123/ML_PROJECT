# End-to-End Student Performance Prediction

Welcome to the End-to-End Student Performance Prediction project! This repository contains code for predicting student performance using machine learning techniques. Whether you're an educator looking to identify students who may need extra support or a researcher exploring factors influencing academic outcomes, this project provides tools for analyzing and predicting student performance.

## Introduction

In this project, we develop a comprehensive pipeline for predicting student performance from start to finish. We collect data, preprocess it, train machine learning models, evaluate their performance, and deploy the best-performing model for predictions on new data.

## Features

### Gender
- **Description:** Gender of the student.
- **Possible Values:** Male, Female.

### Race/Ethnicity
- **Description:** Ethnicity or racial background of the student.
- **Possible Values:** Group A, Group B, Group C, Group D, Group E.

### Parental Level of Education
- **Description:** Education level attained by the student's parents.
- **Possible Values:** Some high school, High school, Some college, Associate's degree, Bachelor's degree, Master's degree.

### Lunch
- **Description:** Type of lunch received by the student.
- **Possible Values:** Standard, Free/reduced.

### Test Preparation Course
- **Description:** Whether the student completed a test preparation course.
- **Possible Values:** Completed, None.

### Math Score
- **Description:** Score obtained by the student in the math exam.

### Reading Score
- **Description:** Score obtained by the student in the reading exam.

### Writing Score
- **Description:** Score obtained by the student in the writing exam.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found in the `data` directory. It includes information on student demographics, parental education, lunch type, test preparation, and exam scores. We provide a comprehensive dataset to facilitate research and analysis in the field of student performance prediction.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to acknowledge the contributions of the open-source community and the creators of the datasets used in this project. Your efforts help advance research and promote understanding in the field of student performance prediction.
